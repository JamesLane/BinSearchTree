Files and classes in BinSearchTree v20130422

Primary API files:
    BinSearchTree.hpp
        Contains tBinSearchTree, the primary tree template class.
        Derived from tBinSearchTreeBase and tBinSearchNode.

    BinSearchTreeIter.hpp
        Contains tIterator, a standard bidirectional iterator template class.

Internal files:
    BinSearchNode.hpp
        Contains tBinSearchNode, a node class template.
        Derived from tBinSearchNodeBase.
        (There is no corresponding "BinSearchNode.cpp".)

    BinSearchNodeBase.cpp
        Contains support code related to tBinSearchNodeBase:
            Small sequence functions to find the first or last node in a tree
            Small sequence functions to increment / decrement to the next / previous node in a tree.

    BinSearchNodeBase.hpp
        Contains tBinSearchNodeBase, a non-template node base class.
        Basic node data (pointers to the parent and child nodes).

    BinSearchTreeBase.cpp
        Contains support code for tBinSearchTreeBase:
            Functions to create the sequences used by the fast iterator, and
            Fast sequence functions to increment/decrement to the next/previous node in the tree.

    BinSearchTreeBase.hpp
        Contains tBinSearchTreeBase, a non-template tree base class.
        Most of the Tree data is here, along with the Tree maintenance functions that don't depend on the types of the Key or Value.
